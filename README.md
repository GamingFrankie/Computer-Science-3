# Notice

This is the homework for Computer Science 3 (ICS3U1).

I provide the solution to each question with a multiple entries program named [X](https://github.com/GamingFrankie/Computer-Science-3/blob/master/Wave%201/Farmland.py), 

along with a sigle entry version named [X-Simplyfied](https://github.com/GamingFrankie/Computer-Science-3/blob/master/Wave%201/Farmland-Simplified.py).

This only applies to [Wave 1](https://github.com/GamingFrankie/Computer-Science-3/tree/master/Wave%201) and [Wave 2](https://github.com/GamingFrankie/Computer-Science-3/tree/master/Wave%202).

Where X is the name of the program, click to see the actual example.

Pleacse check [Projects](https://github.com/GamingFrankie/Computer-Science-3/projects) for detailed completion status.

Please provide me with any suggestions by adding a pull request.

Also, I might ask some question under [Issues](https://github.com/GamingFrankie/Computer-Science-3/issues).
